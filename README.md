# Parkinsons-Disease-Detection
## Overview
Worked on a medical computer vision project involving Parkinson's disease detection by using sklearn.
Used **Random Forest Classifier** and **Decision tree classifier** in this project to find out the model accuracy.
Also use of **Na√Øve Bayce  algorithm** and **KNN** used to figure out the training and test model accuracy.

## Libraries Used
1.Numpy</br>
2.sklearn</br>
3.pandas</br>
4.Seaborn</br>
5.Matplotlib</br>
6.xgBoost</br>


## Results

Model accuracy on train is:  **87%**
Model accuracy on test is:  **89%**

in **KNN**
Model accuracy on train is:  **91%**
Model accuracy on test is:  **85%**
